## Project Overview
This project presents a detailed analysis of user and ride funnels for Metrocar, a ride-sharing app, focusing on optimization opportunities to improve user retention, ride completion rates, and overall platform efficiency. The goal of this analysis was to identify pain points in the user journey and develop data-driven recommendations to enhance Metrocar's performance and customer satisfaction.

The project analyzed user and ride data from January 2021 to April 2022, covering over 6,233 users and 212,628 completed rides, with a total revenue of $4,251,668. The analysis helped uncover key conversion rate drop-offs, platform usage insights, and customer behavior trends. Data manipulation and visualizations were performed using Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

## Key Questions
The analysis focused on answering several important business questions:

- Where does the highest drop-off occur in the user funnel?

- Which age demographic performs best in terms of conversion rates?

- What factors contribute to ride cancellations and how can they be mitigated?

- How can surge pricing be optimized without causing a decline in user retention?

- What can be done to improve driver performance and user satisfaction?

## Methods and Tools
### Data Processing and Analysis:

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed to uncover patterns, outliers, and trends in user behavior.

**Funnel Analysis:** Constructed separate user and ride funnels to track conversion rates from app downloads to ride completion and user reviews.

**Platform-Based Insights:** Analyzed platform preferences (iOS, Android, Web) and identified opportunities to optimize user acquisition on Android.

**Age-Based Performance:** Examined age group performance and conversion rates, highlighting the critical need to address unknown age ranges in the data.

### Tools:

**- Pandas:** Used for data wrangling, cleaning, and aggregating funnel data.

**- Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib:** Employed for visualizing data trends, funnel stages, and ride-request peaks by time of day.

**- SQL:** For querying the raw data from the database before analysis.

## Key Insights

### Funnel Drop-offs:
A 49% drop-off occurred between the rides accepted and rides completed stages, mainly due to driver availability, user cancellations, and communication issues.
A 35% drop-off was found between ride requests and accepted rides, likely due to insufficient driver supply.

### Platform Usage:
iOS users accounted for 60% of total usage, while Android made up 30%, revealing a discrepancy between Metrocarâ€™s user base and the smartphone market share.

### Demographics & Retention:
The 35-44 age group had the highest conversion rates across all funnel stages, making them a key target for Metrocar.
Approximately 30% of users did not provide their age range during signup, limiting accurate customer segmentation.
Retention rate dropped to 25% after 60 days, indicating the need for better retention strategies.

### Surge Pricing and Cancellation:
Peak ride requests occurred during rush hours (7 AM - 10 AM and 3 PM - 8 PM), making these periods prime for surge pricing, but also contributing to cancellations due to higher fares.

## Recommendations

Based on the findings, the following recommendations were provided:

**- Enhance Driver Support:** Provide better navigation tools and real-time traffic updates.

**- Improve Communication:** Establish clearer communication between drivers and users during pickup.

**- Optimize Surge Pricing:** Adjust pricing strategies to balance profitability with user retention during peak hours.

**- Age-Range Mandate:** Make age range entry mandatory during signup for improved user segmentation and marketing.

**- Increase Driver Base:** Expand the number of drivers to reduce ride cancellations due to lack of driver availability.

**- Tailored Marketing:** Focus marketing efforts on the 35-44 age group and explore ways to re-engage users with unknown age groups.

**- Loyalty Programs:** Introduce loyalty programs to boost retention and reward repeat customers.

## Conclusion
This project highlights key opportunities for Metrocar to optimize its platform by improving driver availability, communication, and targeting the most valuable user demographics. By addressing the drop-offs in the customer and ride funnels and refining surge pricing strategies, Metrocar can increase its revenue, improve user satisfaction, and enhance overall platform performance.
